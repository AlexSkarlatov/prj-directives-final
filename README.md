summary of whats going:
basically I did some research on how to connect my git hub account to my ide so i can more quickly and conveniently do version control, this is the result. it was fairly straght forward after authentication. this is the same as the repository "food-app-udemy" because in my filesystem it was named something differently it ended up i ould only create a new repository and ot synchronize with a pre existing repository. still looking how to do that.
